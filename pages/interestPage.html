                          One of my favorite pass time is watching streamers. I
                          have always been a gamer and I naturally began
                          watching streamers who streamed games. I have now
                          transitioned into watching Vtubers. Vtubers are
                          virtual streamers, who use a 2D or 3D model in place
                          of streaming in real life. Of the Vtubers, I mostly
                          watch Hololive. Hololive is a vtuber talent agency
                          that hire talents as virtual idols. I enjoy watching
                          these girls play games, draw, sing and do all other
                          sorts of activities. My personal Oshi, or favorite
                          vtuber, is Ninomae Ina'nis from HololiveEN Myth.

                        I have been a gamer for as far back as I can remember. I
                        think games were just a way for my to explore all these
                        different stories. I tend towards role-playing games
                        (RPGs) and shooters. Those prefeneces probably come from
                        two of my most favorite game franchises: Halo and
                        Warcraft. Halo is a sci-fi shooter and is very dear to
                        me because I can still remember when my brother bought
                        me Halo: Combat Evolved when it first came out and just
                        being blown away by ther game. Since I was young, I have
                        been a Blizzard fan. Whether it was Warcraft, Starcraft,
                        or Diablo, I have bought and enjoyed all their games. I
                        also have spent 10 years of my life playing World of
                        Warcraft and am still currently subscribed. </div>

                          Ever since I was a child, sports have been a big part
                          of my life. I have never had any ambiition to become
                          pro but because I grew up in such a big family, sports
                          was one of the main activity that I did with my
                          family. My favorite sport is football, as shown in the
                          picture to the left. I grew up playing backyard
                          football and watching the NFL. My favorite team is the
                          San Francisco 49ers. I also played other sports like
                          basketball and tennis. I played tennis all throughout
                          highschool.</div>
